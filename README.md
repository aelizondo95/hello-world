# hello-world
My first repository.

Hello everyone!

My name is Alejandro.  I am 24 years old and a recent graduate with a B.Sc. in Chemical Engineering.
I'm looking to expand my abilities by learning how to code and using python for Data Science.
Whenever I'm not learning I like to listen to music and play guitar.
